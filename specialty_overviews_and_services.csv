Successful Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty in a single sitting was carried out on a 95-year old man, at Apollo Hospitals, Sheshadripuram Orthopedic  Services & Treatments: Arthroscopy or Keyhole Surgery The Orthopedic surgeons at Apollo Hospitals, Bangalore can diagnose and treat many types of bone and joint problems using minimally invasive techniques. Most minimally invasive orthopedic surgeries are done with the use of an arthroscope, a special thin tool designed for viewing and treating problems inside a joint. The arthroscope is so slim that it can be inserted into the joint through one or more tiny “keyhole” cuts through the skin, rather than longer incisions. The arthroscope is fitted with a state-of-the-art miniature camera and a specialized lighting system that enables the structures inside the joint to be viewed on a monitor. The surgeon can attach special tools to the end of the arthroscope to shave, cut, or remove tissue or bone that are causing problems. Arthroscopic or keyhole surgeries of the joints are routinely performed. The most common arthroscopic procedures include repairing cartilage and meniscus problems in the knee, and removing inflammation and repairing rotator cuff tears in the shoulder. Apollo Hospitals performs arthroscopies on a routine basis. Apollo Knee Check The Apollo Knee Check is the cornerstone of the Knee clinic and is the vital factor that pins down the exact cause and origin of the knee disorder thereby ensuring evidence based management. The best orthopedic hospital in Bangalore like Apollo Hospitals has been the pioneer for the Preventive Check program in our country and has over the years launched many need based health check packages. The Knee Check is yet another unique program specifically designed to include diagnostic tests that target knee disorders. In all, the Apollo KNEE CLINIC is a one-stop center catering to the end-to-end needs of a patient with knee pain with a 360 degree approach. We hope that in the enduring Apollo tradition of touching lives, The Knee clinic will reach out and alleviate the burden of pain, immobility, incapacitation and impaired activity and productivity that can be caused by knee disorders. Apollo Knee Clinic Disease profile is undergoing rapid transformation in India and infectious diseases are fast giving way to lifestyle diseases. Knee pain and knee related disease and disability is one such major chronic disease that incapacitates people of all age groups. Knee pain is one of the commonest problems that many people face in their day to day lives. Indeed, over 4 million people over 60 years of age and over 6 million people across all age groups need help for knee pain and disorders. Factors such as aspiration for a longer and more active life, increasing life expectancy and injuries are leading to an increased incidence of hospital visits due to knee pain. While a variety of options are available today both in traditional and alternative medicine for management of knee pain, most of these options are incomplete and sub-optimal. Patients move from hospital to hospital and from doctor to doctor in search of pain relief often without desired results. The need for a comprehensive center for managing knee disorders was therefore obvious and was also articulated by many patients. Therefore we at Apollo Hospitals, also known as the best ortho care center in Bangalore, decided to create a comprehensive solution for knee pain integrating the different elements of managing a knee disorder. Starting from prevention through early diagnosis, medical intervention, and surgical intervention to rehabilitation, the Apollo Knee Clinic aims to offer a complete program for people suffering from knee disorders due to causes ranging from arthritis, age, sports injuries and obesity.

Arthroscopy and repair of rotator cuff tear with decompression if required. Research into the vaguely known shoulder entities in common people. Dedicated shoulder therapist and innovative rehabilitation customized to patients’ troubles. Dedicated imaging of the shoulder. Shoulder Labrum is a fibro-cartilagenous tissue which increases the surface area of glenoid. When torn it leads to instability of the shoulder. Recurrent dislocation or recurrent pain while using the shoulder is the feature that comes due to labral tears. Labral tear’s need to be repaired in time to prevent further tear progression and also loss of bone socket of shoulder. These tears can be fully treated (key hole) arthroscopically. Rotator cuffs are important stabilizing muscles in the shoulder, which if torn has to be repaired. After repair adequately, long rehabilitation is required for this muscle to function back. Patients with frozen shoulders who don’t get back adequate movements even after 4-6 months of adequate rehabilitation can be treated with capsular releases in a targeted way to get back lost movements. In patients whose cuff tears have over time led to muscle atrophy, we do provide advanced surgery in turn of reverse shoulder replacement. Labral tear repair Bankart’s repair Superior labral A-P tear repair Global tear repair Global capsulorrhaphy Global capsular release for frozen shoulder or targeted release Rotator cuff repair Suprascapular nerve release Mini Open AC Joint Reconstruction Open Reverse Joint Replacement Keyhole surgery for disorders of the knee, shoulder, elbow and ankle Trauma and Fracture surgery High quality Swiss ‘AO’ systems help stabilize fractures Image intensifier, confirms perfect fracture fixations Ilizarov and External Fixation Device Management of open fractures Infected nonunion of long bones Limb lengthening Correction of deformities Fusion of joints Total Hip Replacement Surgery The end portion of the thighbone affected by arthritis is replaced with a metal head that can be cemented with special glue to the stem of the thighbone (or) can be uncemented (in younger patients). The socket is replaced with a metallic cup and high density plastic is used as an insert into it. The socket is usually left uncemented (screws are used to connect to the thighbone). The Total Hip Replacement procedure enables restoration of the natural gliding motion of the joint. What is a total hip replacement? When the hip joint has worn to the point when it no longer does its job, an artificial hip (called prosthesis) made of metal and plastic can take its place. The surgery to implant the prosthesis is termed a total hip replacement. The hip replacement recreates the normal function of the hip. While the idea of getting an artificial hip joint may be frightening to some, it is one of the safest and most effective medical procedures. Total hip replacement, which entails replacing the acetabulum with an artificial liner as well as replacing the proximal femur with an artificial stem, is an excellent procedure for the treatment of hip pain and arthritis. Furthermore, it provides for a more mobile hip. Who should have a total hip replacement? Total hip replacement is recommended for arthritic patients with severe pain and limited function. Patients at our Apollo Hospitals, Bangalore affiliate are encouraged to participate in a joint replacement seminar. Benefits The most apparent benefit of hip replacement is dramatic pain relief. Almost all patients have complete, or near complete, relief of pain. As the pain lessens, function also improves. Most patients have better range of motion and limp less. Knee Replacement Arthritis is inflammation of the joints. A gradual wearing away of the tissue on the ends of bones results in reduction of joint space and friction at the exposed bone surfaces, changing regular bone movement and causing severe pain. Knee Replacement Surgery is the best solution to treat the condition and allow resumption of normal activities in the knee. The types of arthritis are: Osteoarthritis This occurs after the age of 50 in individuals with a family history of arthritis. The tissue that cushions the bones of the knee softens and wears away. The bones then rub against one another, causing knee pain and stiffness. Rheumatoid Arthritis This is a disease in which the inner membrane of joints is thickened and inflamed. This results in excessive production of the fluid that lubricates these joints. This chronic inflammation can damage the tissue covering the ends of the bones and eventually result in loss of the tissue, pain and stiffness. Traumatic Arthritis It can result from a serious knee injury. A knee fracture or severe tears of the knee’s connective tissue may damage the tissue covering the ends of the bones over time, causing knee pain and limiting knee function. Symptoms Of Arthritis Severe pain in the joint that restricts everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and getting up from chairs. Severe pain while resting. Inflammation and swelling of the joint that does not improve with medication and rest. Deformity in the joint. Joint stiffness or inability to move the joint in a normal manner. Knee ACL Surgery Is To Reconstruct The Torn ACL In Knee. Commonly 3 Grafts Are Used: Hamstring tendons. Bone tendon Bone graft. Central Quadriceps tendon. These grafts are fixed in anatomical positions using various implant options. Anatomical ACL Reconstruction The standard ACL reconstruction has provided great stability to the knee but has been now proved to not halt progression of osteoarthritis. So, in order to provide stability to the knee and also prevent or retard the development of osteoarthritis, a new concept with ACL evolved around mid 2005 in the USA. This new concept is called the Anatomical Reconstruction of ACL. With the advent of higher technology in arthroscopy, it became very safe to go into highly difficult places in the knee. We routinely not just do Anatomical ACL reconstruction with Bone tendon Bone graft but also Hamstring tendons are used. In patients whose graft quality is good and not yet any osteoarthritis, the knee is considered for Anatomical double bundle ACL reconstruction. Combined Ligamentous Injuries When the ACL, PCL & PLC (posterolateral complex) is torn, we reconstruct all ligaments using arthroscopic and open techniques to restore knee stability. Isolated PCL is also treated surgically if ER III laxity is found with Anatomical PCL reconstruction. Patellofemoral Diseases In case of maltracking of kneecap and in patients where kneecaps regularly comes out and fall back, we offer specialized services Knee patellofemoral specialized rehabilitation In case, medial patellofemoral ligament is turned, this MPFL can be minimally invasively corrected If needed tibial tuberosity shifts are done to allow a normal patellofemoral tracking. Cartilage Injuries Cartilage is the shock absorber of every joint, which also allows frictionless movement in Joints. Till around 2008, for cartilage injuries the scope of healing was very limited. Now we have many options to optimally allow cartilage healing. Micro Fracturing Technique Transfer of cartilage from a non important part of the joint to weight bearing injured areas called OATS. Modern techniques called Chondrocyte transfer or replantation have become possible with the advent of laboratories where cartilage can be grown in artificial media and transferred to injured areas to allow normal cartilage to form. Proxima Hip Replacement The Proxima Hip Replacement is also ideal for young patients. In this minimally-invasive procedure, the part of the thigh bone at the point where it begins is shaped and replaced by a metal head. This sits in a metal cup that is fitted into the socket. Bilateral and Revision Hip Replacements are also done at the best Orthopedic hospital in Bangalore i.e Apollo Hospitals, India. Some hip surgeries can also be performed using minimally-invasive techniques. Partial Knee Replacement This minimally invasive procedure is an option for arthritis patients in whom only one part of the knee has been affected. In a Partial Knee Replacement the diseased portion is removed and replaced with a metal implant. Revision Hip Surgery Revision surgery is different in that the original components are removed and new components are implanted. The technical aspects of the surgery are more complex than the original total hip replacement. However, the preparation for surgery and hospital experience tends to be very similar to the primary total hip replacement. The choices for implant are also the same; both cemented and cementless components are used depending on the patient’s needs and the quality of bone present at surgery. Possible Complications The most common complications of total hip surgery can now largely be avoided. Before surgery each patient receives a complete medical examination by a doctor, as well as routine testing. Donation of one’s own blood prior to surgery can eliminate the problem of HIV and Hepatitis completely. Possible local complications include: loosening, wear or breakage of the prosthesis, hip dislocation, infection, pain, stiffness, leg length inequality, delayed healing of bone and soft tissues, and heterotopic bone formation. Other rare complications include fracture of the femur or acetabulum, nerve and vascular injury. Medical complications include: thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism (blood clot), urological complications and even death (0.1%) Other rare complications, which can be encountered with any surgery, include cardiac, digestive and lung problems. Total Knee Replacement For patients suffering from severe arthritis that can cause acute pain and make even routine activities difficult, Total Knee Replacement is the best solution. The procedure involves removing all diseased portions of bone and tissue on their ends, and replacing them with metal and high density plastic components shaped to create a structure that allows normal movement of the joint. Other knee deformities will also be corrected during the Surgery. High Tibial Osteotomy An osteotomy is Surgery that involves shaping and realigning of bones at a joint. It is usually used to treat arthritis in young patients, and is particularly recommended for those with very shallow joint sockets. In High Tibial Osteotomy the upper part of the tibia – one of the limbs forming the lower leg – is resurrected, mostly by removing a small part of bone in the area.` FAQs Q1. What are some of the most common orthopedic problems? Ans. Orthopedic problems, such as arthritis and bursitis, affect the musculoskeletal system, which consists mostly of bones and joints. They can lead to awkwardness and dysfunction, making even simple daily chores challenging. Q2. How long does recovery take following orthopedic surgery? Ans. The length of recovery varies based on the specific procedure. For example, the recovery duration following ACL surgery ranges from eight to twelve months. However, the recovery period following a knee replacement procedure is usually 3 to 6 weeks. Q3. After orthopedic surgery, what type of aftercare is necessary? Ans. Physical rehabilitation, pain management, and doctor follow-ups are possible components of post-operative treatment following orthopedic surgery. A speedy and complete recovery depends on adhering to the doctor’s recommendations. Q4. Why should I choose Apollo Hospitals for my Orthopaedic? Ans.

Orthopedic  Services & Treatments:
Arthroscopy or Keyhole Surgery
The Orthopedic surgeons at Apollo Hospitals, Bangalore can diagnose and treat many types of bone and joint problems using minimally invasive techniques. Most minimally invasive orthopedic surgeries are done with the use of an arthroscope, a special thin tool designed for viewing and treating problems inside a joint. The arthroscope is so slim that it can be inserted into the joint through one or more tiny “keyhole” cuts through the skin, rather than longer incisions.
The arthroscope is fitted with a state-of-the-art miniature camera and a specialized lighting system that enables the structures inside the joint to be viewed on a monitor. The surgeon can attach special tools to the end of the arthroscope to shave, cut, or remove tissue or bone that are causing problems. Arthroscopic or keyhole surgeries of the joints are routinely performed.
The most common arthroscopic procedures include repairing cartilage and meniscus problems in the knee, and removing inflammation and repairing rotator cuff tears in the shoulder. Apollo Hospitals performs arthroscopies on a routine basis.
Apollo Knee Check
The Apollo Knee Check is the cornerstone of the Knee clinic and is the vital factor that pins down the exact cause and origin of the knee disorder thereby ensuring evidence based management. The best orthopedic hospital in Bangalore like Apollo Hospitals has been the pioneer for the Preventive Check program in our country and has over the years launched many need based health check packages.
The Knee Check is yet another unique program specifically designed to include diagnostic tests that target knee disorders. In all, the Apollo KNEE CLINIC is a one-stop center catering to the end-to-end needs of a patient with knee pain with a 360 degree approach. We hope that in the enduring Apollo tradition of touching lives, The Knee clinic will reach out and alleviate the burden of pain, immobility, incapacitation and impaired activity and productivity that can be caused by knee disorders.
Apollo Knee Clinic
Disease profile is undergoing rapid transformation in India and infectious diseases are fast giving way to lifestyle diseases. Knee pain and knee related disease and disability is one such major chronic disease that incapacitates people of all age groups.
Knee pain is one of the commonest problems that many people face in their day to day lives. Indeed, over 4 million people over 60 years of age and over 6 million people across all age groups need help for knee pain and disorders.
Factors such as aspiration for a longer and more active life, increasing life expectancy and injuries are leading to an increased incidence of hospital visits due to knee pain.
While a variety of options are available today both in traditional and alternative medicine for management of knee pain, most of these options are incomplete and sub-optimal. Patients move from hospital to hospital and from doctor to doctor in search of pain relief often without desired results. The need for a comprehensive center for managing knee disorders was therefore obvious and was also articulated by many patients.
Therefore we at Apollo Hospitals, also known as the best ortho care center in Bangalore, decided to create a comprehensive solution for knee pain integrating the different elements of managing a knee disorder.
Starting from prevention through early diagnosis, medical intervention, and surgical intervention to rehabilitation, the Apollo Knee Clinic aims to offer a complete program for people suffering from knee disorders due to causes ranging from arthritis, age, sports injuries and obesity.
Research, inputs from experts in orthopedics and physiotherapy and the expertise and experience of the entire Orthopedic team at the best ortho care center in Bangalore like Apollo Hospitals has provided the inputs required for this program. Wherever possible the protocols and guidelines have been benchmarked with global institutions to ensure that the outcomes are comparable to the best institutions in the world.
The Apollo Knee Clinic and Program addresses every aspect of joint health .This encompasses the entire gamut of healthcare options for knee care, including
Prevention of knee disorders by creating awareness among the public. Early and precise diagnosis by the exclusive knee checks packages. Preventing disease progression: by our Disease Management Program that offers long term support and service to people with knee disorders. Effective and world class Treatment: through integrated proactive physiotherapy & exercise, Arthroscopic and minimally invasive procedures, and Knee replacement. surgery by some of the most renowned experts in Orthopedic and Joint replacement surgery. Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy. Weight management. Research: on the use of regenerative techniques to manage knee pain and arthritis using stem cells, cartilage transplantation etc. Management of sports related disorders and injuries to knees.
Apollo Shoulder Check
Prevention of shoulder problems- young and old. Early and precise diagnosis to re correct through shoulder rehab the perfect biomechanics of shoulder. Arthroscopy and repair of rotator cuff tear with decompression if required. Research into the vaguely known shoulder entities in common people. Dedicated shoulder therapist and innovative rehabilitation customized to patients’ troubles. Dedicated imaging of the shoulder.
Shoulder
Labrum is a fibro-cartilagenous tissue which increases the surface area of glenoid. When torn it leads to instability of the shoulder. Recurrent dislocation or recurrent pain while using the shoulder is the feature that comes due to labral tears. Labral tear’s need to be repaired in time to prevent further tear progression and also loss of bone socket of shoulder. These tears can be fully treated (key hole) arthroscopically. Rotator cuffs are important stabilizing muscles in the shoulder, which if torn has to be repaired.
After repair adequately, long rehabilitation is required for this muscle to function back. Patients with frozen shoulders who don’t get back adequate movements even after 4-6 months of adequate rehabilitation can be treated with capsular releases in a targeted way to get back lost movements.
In patients whose cuff tears have over time led to muscle atrophy, we do provide advanced surgery in turn of reverse shoulder replacement.

Total Hip Replacement Surgery
The end portion of the thighbone affected by arthritis is replaced with a metal head that can be cemented with special glue to the stem of the thighbone (or) can be uncemented (in younger patients). The socket is replaced with a metallic cup and high density plastic is used as an insert into it. The socket is usually left uncemented (screws are used to connect to the thighbone). The Total Hip Replacement procedure enables restoration of the natural gliding motion of the joint.
What is a total hip replacement?
When the hip joint has worn to the point when it no longer does its job, an artificial hip (called prosthesis) made of metal and plastic can take its place. The surgery to implant the prosthesis is termed a total hip replacement. The hip replacement recreates the normal function of the hip. While the idea of getting an artificial hip joint may be frightening to some, it is one of the safest and most effective medical procedures.
Total hip replacement, which entails replacing the acetabulum with an artificial liner as well as replacing the proximal femur with an artificial stem, is an excellent procedure for the treatment of hip pain and arthritis. Furthermore, it provides for a more mobile hip.
Who should have a total hip replacement?
Total hip replacement is recommended for arthritic patients with severe pain and limited function. Patients at our Apollo Hospitals, Bangalore affiliate are encouraged to participate in a joint replacement seminar.
Benefits
The most apparent benefit of hip replacement is dramatic pain relief. Almost all patients have complete, or near complete, relief of pain. As the pain lessens, function also improves. Most patients have better range of motion and limp less.
Knee Replacement
Arthritis is inflammation of the joints. A gradual wearing away of the tissue on the ends of bones results in reduction of joint space and friction at the exposed bone surfaces, changing regular bone movement and causing severe pain. Knee Replacement Surgery is the best solution to treat the condition and allow resumption of normal activities in the knee.
The types of arthritis are:
Osteoarthritis
This occurs after the age of 50 in individuals with a family history of arthritis. The tissue that cushions the bones of the knee softens and wears away. The bones then rub against one another, causing knee pain and stiffness.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
This is a disease in which the inner membrane of joints is thickened and inflamed. This results in excessive production of the fluid that lubricates these joints. This chronic inflammation can damage the tissue covering the ends of the bones and eventually result in loss of t",,,,,,,
e tissue, pain and stiffness.,,,,,,,,
Traumatic Arthritis,,,,,,,,,
It can result from a serious knee injury. A knee fracture or severe tears of the knee’s connective tissue may damage the tissue covering the ends of the bones over time, causing knee pain and limiting knee function.,,,,,,,,
Symptoms Of Arthritis,,,,,,,,,
Severe pain in the joint that restricts everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs and getting up from chairs. Severe pain while resting. Inflammation and swelling of the joint that does not improve with medication and rest. Deformity in the joint. Joint stiffness or inability to move the joint in a normal manner.,,,,,,,,
Knee,,,,,,,,,
ACL Surgery Is To Reconstruct The Torn ACL In Knee. Commonly 3 Grafts Are Used:,,,,,,,,,
Hamstring tendons. Bone tendon Bone graft. Central Quadriceps tendon.,,,,,,,,,
These grafts are fixed in anatomical positions using various implant options.,,,,,,,,,
Anatomical ACL Reconstruction,,,,,,,,,
The standard ACL reconstruction has provided great stability to the knee but has been now proved to not halt progression of osteoarthritis. So, in order to provide stability to the knee and also prevent or retard the development of osteoarthritis, a new concept with ACL evolved around mid 2005 in the USA. This new concept is called the Anatomical Reconstruction of ACL. With the advent of higher technology in arthroscopy, it became very safe to go into highly difficult places in the knee.,,,,,,
We routinely not just do Anatomical ACL reconstruction with Bone tendon Bone graft but also Hamstring tendons are used. In patients whose graft quality is good and not yet any osteoarthritis, the knee is considered for Anatomical double bundle ACL reconstruction.,,,,,,,,
Combined Ligamentous Injuries,,,,,,,,,
When the ACL, PCL & PLC (posterolateral complex) is torn, we reconstruct all ligaments using arthroscopic and open techniques to restore knee stability. Isolated PCL is also treated surgically if ER III laxity is found with Anatomical PCL reconstruction.,,,,,,,
Patellofemoral Diseases,,,,,,,,,
In case of maltracking of kneecap and in patients where kneecaps regularly comes out and fall back, we offer specialized services Knee patellofemoral specialized rehabilitation,,,,,,,,
In case, medial patellofemoral ligament is turned, this MPFL can be minimally invasively corrected If needed tibial tuberosity shifts are done to allow a normal patellofemoral tracking.,,,,,,,
Cartilage Injuries,,,,,,,,,
Cartilage is the shock absorber of every joint, which also allows frictionless movement in Joints. Till around 2008, for cartilage injuries the scope of healing was very limited. Now we have many options to optimally allow cartilage healing.,,,,,,,
Micro Fracturing Technique,,,,,,,,,
Transfer of cartilage from a non important part of the joint to weight bearing injured areas called OATS.,,,,,,,,,
Modern techniques called Chondrocyte transfer or replantation have become possible with the advent of laboratories where cartilage can be grown in artificial media and transferred to injured areas to allow normal cartilage to form.,,,,,,,,,
Proxima Hip Replacement,,,,,,,,,
The Proxima Hip Replacement is also ideal for young patients. In this minimally-invasive procedure, the part of the thigh bone at the point where it begins is shaped and replaced by a metal head. This sits in a metal cup that is fitted into the socket.,,,,,,,,
Bilateral and Revision Hip Replacements are also done at the best Orthopedic hospital in Bangalore i.e Apollo Hospitals, India. Some hip surgeries can also be performed using minimally-invasive techniques.,,,,,,,,
Partial Knee Replacement,,,,,,,,,
This minimally invasive procedure is an option for arthritis patients in whom only one part of the knee has been affected.,,,,,,,,,
In a Partial Knee Replacement the diseased portion is removed and replaced with a metal implant.,,,,,,,,,
Revision Hip Surgery,,,,,,,,,
Revision surgery is different in that the original components are removed and new components are implanted. The technical aspects of the surgery are more complex than the original total hip replacement. However, the preparation for surgery and hospital experience tends to be very similar to the primary total hip replacement. The choices for implant are also the same; both cemented and cementless components are used depending on the patient’s needs and the quality of bone present at surgery.,,,,,,,,
Possible Complications,,,,,,,,,
The most common complications of total hip surgery can now largely be avoided. Before surgery each patient receives a complete medical examination by a doctor, as well as routine testing. Donation of one’s own blood prior to surgery can eliminate the problem of HIV and Hepatitis completely.,,,,,,,,
Possible local complications include: loosening, wear or breakage of the prosthesis, hip dislocation, infection, pain, stiffness, leg length inequality, delayed healing of bone and soft tissues, and heterotopic bone formation. Other rare complications include fracture of the femur or acetabulum, nerve and vascular injury.
Medical complications include: thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism (blood clot), urological complications and even death (0.1%) Other rare complications, which can be encountered with any surgery, include cardiac, digestive and lung problems.,,,,
Total Knee Replacement,,,,,,,,,
For patients suffering from severe arthritis that can cause acute pain and make even routine activities difficult, Total Knee Replacement is the best solution. The procedure involves removing all diseased portions of bone and tissue on their ends, and replacing them with metal and high density plastic components shaped to create a structure that allows normal movement of the joint. Other knee deformities will also be corrected during the Surgery.,,,,,,,
High Tibial Osteotomy,,,,,,,,,
An osteotomy is Surgery that involves shaping and realigning of bones at a joint. It is usually used to treat arthritis in young patients, and is particularly recommended for those with very shallow joint sockets.,,,,,,,,
In High Tibial Osteotomy the upper part of the tibia – one of the limbs forming the lower leg – is resurrected, mostly by removing a small part of bone in the area.`,,,,,,,,
FAQs,,,,,,,,,
Q1. What are some of the most common orthopedic problems?,,,,,,,,,
Ans. Orthopedic problems, such as arthritis and bursitis, affect the musculoskeletal system, which consists mostly of bones and joints. They can lead to awkwardness and dysfunction, making even simple daily chores challenging.,,,,,
Q2. How long does recovery take following orthopedic surgery?,,,,,,,,,
Ans. The length of recovery varies based on the specific procedure. For example, the recovery duration following ACL surgery ranges from eight to twelve months. However, the recovery period following a knee replacement procedure is usually 3 to 6 weeks.,,,,,,,
Q3. After orthopedic surgery, what type of aftercare is necessary?,,,,,,,,
Ans. Physical rehabilitation, pain management, and doctor follow-ups are possible components of post-operative treatment following orthopedic surgery. A speedy and complete recovery depends on adhering to the doctor’s recommendations.,,,,,,,

Neuro Surgeries & Procedures at Apollo – Best Neuro Hospital in Bangalore
Brain and Spine Surgery: This specialty area focuses on the diagnosis and management of diseases involving the nerves, brain, Neck and spinal cord. With today’s sophisticated methods, minimally invasive procedures—which entail fewer blood losses, shorter recovery times, and smaller incisions—are used to perform brain and spine surgeries. Micro-Neurosurgery: This type of neurosurgery involves using specialised instruments and cutting-edge surgical techniques to operate on sensitive brain and nervous system components precisely and minimally invasively. Neuro-Endoscopic Surgery: A tiny, flexible tube with a light and camera attached to it is used in this minimally invasive surgical technique. The apparatus is utilised for diagnosing and treating a range of neurological disorders as well as specific malignancies of the brain and spine. Cyberknife: This robotic INAC treats patients with brain, neck, and spine problems with extreme precision and minimally invasive techniques. It has real-time imaging guidance. Vertebroplasty: A minimally invasive, image-guided nonsurgical treatment called vertebroplasty is used to strengthen and stabilise a vertebrae or spinal cord that has been compromised by diseases like cancer or osteoporosis. Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Low doses of radiation are directed towards the damaged region while causing the least amount of damage to the surrounding healthy tissue by using 3-D imaging. Small radiation beams are focused on the tumor by the complex apparatus, and the intersection of all the beams receives tailored radiation treatment.

Interventional Radiology,https://www.apollohospitals.com/region/bangalore/departments/interventional-radiology/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/,"Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Treatment in Bangalore BPH, expanded as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, is a condition in which the prostate and its surrounding tissue expand. It is a fairly common condition in older men. It is normal for the prostate to enlarge as men get older. However, sometimes it may enlarge to a size that starts causing medical issues in men. This type of enlargement of the prostate is non-cancerous. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia can cause uncomfortable symptoms in men preventing urine from passing through the urethra as well as bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems. Although Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, the symptoms can be relieved through treatment. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Treatment Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia is usually treated through Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). However, not all patients may be eligible for this surgery. Prostate artery embolization is another approach that may be beneficial in the treatment of BPH in many patients. Prostate Artery Embolization is a minimally invasive form of treatment performed by an interventional radiologist to lower urinary tract symptoms caused by Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). The procedure aims at blocking the blood flow to the prostate to help it reduce in size. Before the Procedure The doctor will prescribe Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE) if the patent is not eligible for traditional treatment approaches for BPH. The doctor will have to run a series of tests and ask relevant questions to the patient to determine if they are eligible for PAE. The doctor will thoroughly ask the patient about their condition and symptoms. Common questions may revolve around asking about the severity, frequency and duration of BPH symptoms. The doctor will also take a thorough medical history and ask about what extent their life is affected by BPH. Then, they may run some or all of the following tests to determine a patient’s eligibility for PAE: Urine test (urinalysis) Blood tests Digital Rectal exam An MRI or Ultrasound of the Prostate Gland. Sometimes the doctor may also run a test called the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) to eliminate prostate cancer probability. It is advised that before the procedure, patients ask any queries they may have with their doctor. During the Procedure The patient is given local anaesthesia before the doctor can begin the procedure. They may also be given a sedative which will keep them awake during the procedure, but they will be slightly drowsy. The interventional radiologist then begins the procedure by inserting a Foley catheter through the urethra. The catheter is positioned in the bladder, wherein it acts as a reference point for the surrounding anatomy. A thin and small catheter is then inserted into the artery found in the patient’s wrist or groyne. The doctor will then guide the catheter into the vessels that supply blood to the prostate. The blood vessels that supply blood to the prostate are mapped using an Arteriogram. The IR will then reduce the blood supply to the prostate by injecting tiny round microspheres into the blood vessels through the catheter. The procedure may be repeated for the other side. After the Procedure Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE) is an outpatient procedure, and most patients will be discharged the same day after the procedure. The patients are advised to rest in their homes for at least four days. After a PAE, the blood supply to the prostate is reduced, which causes it to shrink in size, thereby reducing the symptoms of BPH. It is normal to experience six to 12 hours of discomfort after the procedure. Patients will also experience some pain, for which the doctor will prescribe some painkillers. Following the procedure, patients will make a complete recovery experiencing a reduction in BPH symptoms in about a week or ten days. The doctors will ask the patient to return for a follow-up consultation post a week or month after the procedure. They will also order more imaging tests to check the status of the prostate three to six months after the PAE. Complications & Risks Like every medical procedure, PAE may have certain risks involved. Hence one should only opt for an experienced Interventional Radiologist to perform the procedure. Some common symptoms after the procedure include: Mild to a low-grade fever Nausea Painful or frequent urination. Pelvic pain Vomiting These are together referred to as the post-PAE syndrome. A few uncommon complications associated with PAE include: Bladder spasm Blood in the urine, semen, or stool Haematoma at the incision site Infection Who is not eligible for PAE? Not every patient is an ideal candidate for Prostate Artery Embolization. This is why experienced Interventional Radiologists will run certain tests to determine a patient’s eligibility for PAE. In general, patients with a small-sized prostate are not ideal candidates, as large prostates respond well to PAE. Conclusion Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia is a common condition with discomforting symptoms. While there are traditional and more effective methods available for its treatment, not every patient is eligible for such treatment. Prostate Artery Embolization can be an effective treatment modality for such candidates. PAE should only be performed by a highly experienced team of doctors, including top Interventional Radiologists. If you have been prescribed Prostate Artery Embolization surgery, talk to our doctors at Apollo Hospital, Karnataka, about any concerns or queries you may have. Our Interventional Radiologists are experts in performing the PAE procedure and will answer all your queries in detail.

Urine test (urinalysis) Blood tests Digital Rectal exam An MRI or Ultrasound of the Prostate Gland. Sometimes the doctor may also run a test called the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) to eliminate prostate cancer probability.
It is advised that before the procedure, patients ask any queries they may have with their doctor.
During the Procedure
The patient is given local anaesthesia before the doctor can begin the procedure. They may also be given a sedative which will keep them awake during the procedure, but they will be slightly drowsy. The interventional radiologist then begins the procedure by inserting a Foley catheter through the urethra. The catheter is positioned in the bladder, wherein it acts as a reference point for the surrounding anatomy. A thin and small catheter is then inserted into the artery found in the patient’s wrist or groyne. The doctor will then guide the catheter into the vessels that supply blood to the prostate. The blood vessels that supply blood to the prostate are mapped using an Arteriogram. The IR will then reduce the blood supply to the prostate by injecting tiny round microspheres into the blood vessels through the catheter. The procedure may be repeated for the other side.
After the Procedure
Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE) is an outpatient procedure, and most patients will be discharged the same day after the procedure. The patients are advised to rest in their homes for at least four days. After a PAE, the blood supply to the prostate is reduced, which causes it to shrink in size, thereby reducing the symptoms of BPH. It is normal to experience six to 12 hours of discomfort after the procedure. Patients will also experience some pain, for which the doctor will prescribe some painkillers. Following the procedure, patients will make a complete recovery experiencing a reduction in BPH symptoms in about a week or ten days. The doctors will ask the patient to return for a follow-up consultation post a week or month after the procedure. They will also order more imaging tests to check the status of the prostate three to six months after the PAE.
Complications & Risks
Like every medical procedure, PAE may have certain risks involved. Hence one should only opt for an experienced Interventional Radiologist to perform the procedure. Some common symptoms after the procedure include:
Mild to a low-grade fever Nausea Painful or frequent urination. Pelvic pain Vomiting
These are together referred to as the post-PAE syndrome.
A few uncommon complications associated with PAE include:
Bladder spasm Blood in the urine, semen, or stool Haematoma at the incision site Infection
Who is not eligible for PAE?
Not every patient is an ideal candidate for Prostate Artery Embolization. This is why experienced Interventional Radiologists will run certain tests to determine a patient’s eligibility for PAE. In general, patients with a small-sized prostate are not ideal candidates, as large prostates respond well to PAE.
Conclusion
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia is a common condition with discomforting symptoms. While there are traditional and more effective methods available for its treatment, not every patient is eligible for such treatment. Prostate Artery Embolization can be an effective treatment modality for such candidates.
PAE should only be performed by a highly experienced team of doctors, including top Interventional Radiologists. If you have been prescribed Prostate Artery Embolization surgery, talk to our doctors at Apollo Hospital, Karnataka, about any concerns or queries you may have.

General Surgery,https://www.apollohospitals.com/region/bangalore/departments/general-surgery/bariatric-weight-loss-surgery/,"Best Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Hospital in Bangalore A category of medical procedures known as bariatric surgery, often known as weight loss surgery, is intended to help obese patients in losing weight. If alternative weight loss techniques haven’t worked and obesity seems to represent a larger risk to your health than surgery, your bariatric doctor in Bangalore may advise you to have bariatric surgery. Your digestive tract, mostly your stomach but sometimes also your small intestine, is altered during bariatric surgery procedures to limit the number of calories you can intake and absorb. The most typical kind of bariatric surgery is gastric bypass, which is preferred by most doctors and bariatric physician near you because it typically has fewer risks and great results compared to other weight-loss procedures. The patient must permanently alter their diet and set aside time for a set exercise routine to ensure the long-term success of bariatric surgery. Different Types of Bariatric Surgery Performed at Apollo Hospitals, Karnataka Gastric Sleeve – The gastric sleeve, also known as sleeve gastrectomy, is the most often performed bariatric surgery. Gastrectomy essentially eliminates a big portion of your stomach (approximately 80%), leaving behind a tiny, tubular portion similar to a sleeve. Gastric Bypass – Gastric bypass surgery is a bit complex yet more preferred surgical approach compared to sleeve gastrectomy. It entails generating a tiny pouch from the stomach and attaching it straight to the small intestine. Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS) – It is a less prevalent form of weight loss surgery. Similar to a sleeve gastrectomy, your surgeon will undertake this procedure to create a gastric sleeve by removing a piece of the stomach. The sleeve is then connected to a section of the small intestine. Preoperative Preparations of Surgery Bariatric surgery requires more comprehensive planning, which might start a month or two before the actual day of the procedure. The following are some significant preoperative steps: Medication – Patients who are obese often develop ailments, including heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hypertension. They could take medications for the same condition. According to the surgeon’s judgement, their dose may be changed. Additionally, certain medications could be withdrawn. Food Habits – A month before surgery, the patient has been subject to a number of limitations. Foods that are heavy in calories, sugar, or junk are forbidden. Consumption of salads, fruits, and naturally preserved foods is suggested. Evaluation of the Patient’s Physical Condition – The top bariatric surgeon in Bangalore will want to make sure you are physically and mentally prepared for the procedure before scheduling your bariatric surgery. A thorough physical checkup is performed before the procedure. To look for indications of abnormal cardiac functioning, the cardiovascular system is evaluated. Psychological counselling, in addition to other therapeutic approaches, will be required for depression, anxiety, and eating problems that contribute to the development of obesity. It is often best to check into the hospital the day before surgery. After the patient is hospitalised, a comprehensive physical examination is performed once more. What happens during Bariatric Surgery? Under general anaesthesia, the procedure will be carried out. The little incision that your surgeon makes will be used to insert instruments. An adjustable band will be wrapped over the top of your stomach by the surgeon, who will then tighten it to create a tiny pouch. This makes a little opening for the food to flow through in order to migrate from the top small pouch to the lower, bigger portion of the stomach. The incision area will be closed after the procedure is finished. The entire procedure can take 1-2 hours. Post Procedure The patient is transferred to the recovery room right after the surgery. After the anaesthetic agent’s effects start to fade, consciousness returns quickly. A two to three-day hospital stay is required, during which the patient is kept under close monitoring. Depending on how they recuperate, they could be released earlier or later than this period. It typically takes 3–4 weeks to fully recuperate from surgery. In order to reduce the desired amount of weight and keep it off after bariatric surgery, the patient and doctor must work together. The patient is not allowed to eat anything for 1-2 days following the operation. Dietary requirements are met by intravenous administration. The dietician suggests a specific diet consisting of soft, light foods that are simple to digest over the following three to four months. Regular exercise is also a crucial component of weight loss prevention. Avoiding smoking and drinking alcohol as much as you can throughout your life is advised. The patient is also encouraged to visit the bariatric surgeon for routine checkups. These might be carried out once or twice every month. As time goes on, evaluations become less frequent. Risk & Complications Surgical Complications Operations that are longer and more difficult could entail more surgical complications, including: Infection. Bleeding. Blood clots. Small bowel obstruction. Hernias. Anastomotic leaks. Digestive Troubles The usual digestive process undergoes significant alteration after bariatric surgery. Food does not go through the intestines the way it usually does. This could alter how well critical nutrients are absorbed. Malnutrition, constipation, nausea, and vomiting are just a few potential problems. Gallstones are known to develop in those who lose a significant amount of weight quickly. If they are identified in a patient following bariatric surgery, they will get the proper treatment, like medications or corrective surgery, separately. What makes you ineligible for Bariatric Surgery? When discussing weight loss solutions with a medical practitioner, your health is always the primary priority. In certain circumstances, bariatric surgery might result in long-term health problems that are not worth the risk. Some of the most significant risk factors that may restrict you from having bariatric surgery are: Being above the age of 75 or under the age of 16. Having an alcohol or drug addiction.
